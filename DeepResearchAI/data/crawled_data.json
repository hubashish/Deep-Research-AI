If youâve ever interacted with a customer service chatbot or asked a gen AI model to write you a sonnet, then youâre likely already familiar with a rudimentary version of AI agents. And if youâve noticed improvements in gen AIâs performance since it went mainstream with ChatGPT, youâre not wrong. While versions of AI agents have existed for years, the natural-language-processing capabilities of todayâs gen AI models have unleashed a host of new possibilities, which are enabling systems of agents to plan, collaborate, and complete tasksâand even learn to improve their own performance. As agents become more accurate, companies can increasingly use them to automate organizational processes and help make employeesâ day-to-day work more efficient. âThe development of gen AI has been extremely fast,â says McKinsey Senior Partner Lari HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen. âToday, the joint human-plus-machine outcome can generate great quality and great productivity.â Recent developments in short- and long-term memory structuresÂ have enabled these agents to better personalize interactions with both external and internal users, which means the agents are quickly getting better at whatever they are asked to do. Looking ahead, theyâre about to get even better; put simply, AI agents are moving from thought to action. In the past 18 months, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and others have invested in software libraries and frameworks to support agentic functionality. And with applications such as Microsoft Copilot, Amazon Q, and Googleâs upcoming Project Astra, which are powered by large language models (LLMs), agents are making a shift from knowledge-based tools to ones that are more action based. In the near future, agents could become as commonplace as mobile applications are today. Learn more about QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. AI agents can be organized by their capability, role, skill, and the outcome theyâre trained to deliver. Here is a nonexhaustive list of some of the agents being created today: These AI agents are not mutually exclusive. Many organizations will pursue a mixâfor instance, rolling out personal AI copilots while automating select workflows and piloting a few virtual workers.  AI agents can support highly complex and ambiguous use cases across industries and business functions. They can use tools designed for humans, like a web browser, as well as tools designed for computers, such as an API. The ability to do both gives AI agents the flexibility to operate across technology architectures, inside and outside of organizations, without requiring significant modifications to those architectures. The process by which an AI agent works generally follows four stepsÂ (Exhibit 1): Any deployment of AI agents should include a range of controls. Constructive-feedback loops, for example, allow agents to review and refine their work. AI agents can also be programmed to teach themselves to solve problems or to escalate them to a human manager. Agents also can work better together: A critic specialist agent can review a plan created by a creator agent and ask for iterations, which can result in better outputs. Some AI agents can even ask managers direct questions. Organizations can also develop specialized agents to automatically test and correct the output of other agents based on ethical and bias concerns.  Learn more about QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. AI agents work with different AI models to accomplish tasks. When used to communicate with humans, AI agents work with LLMs that are equipped with natural-language-processing capabilities. Take the example of a self-driving car, which runs on a series of agents that work with various AI models. The AI agent in charge of understanding where a user wants to go might use an LLM. But the agent in charge of making sure itâs safe for the car to turn left would use a highly specialized design model, not an LLM, for that specific type of decision.  McKinsey estimates that in the long term, enterprise use cases of gen AI could create up to $4.4 trillionÂ of value annually. However, organizations wonât be able to turn this potential into business growth and higher productivity unless they can quickly implement AI to reimagine and transform how work is done. AI agents can help mine that mountain of value faster, better, and cheaper than other, older technologies. But gen AIâs value goes beyond the automation of common work tasks. McKinsey forecasts that organizations could deploy AI agents to help reimagine processes and modernize their IT infrastructures. This could include everything from switching to easier-to-use programming languages and transitioning to modern frameworks that provide more functionality, to restructuring systems so theyâre more modular and migrating applications to run on cheaper cloud-computing environments. Tech leaders can use multiple specialized AI agents, each with a distinct role and expertise, to collaborate on complex tasks and iterate in real time with feedback from humans. The real value, though, will come from orchestrating agents to complete discrete tasks as well as entire software development processes.  Some industries are already deploying AI agents regularly. Customer service bots, for instance, have become de rigueur on many customer-facing websites. According to McKinsey research on gen AIâs economic potential, organizations using gen AIâenabled customer service agents increased issue resolution by 14 percent per hour and reduced time spent handling issues by 9 percent. âOver time,â says McKinsey Senior Partner Jorge Amar, âI expect to see gen AI agents improve customer satisfaction and generate revenue. They will be critical in selling new services or addressing broader needs. This will open up a wider array of customer experience optionsÂ for companies, such as offering more high-touch interactions with human agents as a premium service.â  More generally, gen AIâenabled agents can potentially ease the automation of complex use cases in three important ways: Whatâs more, according to McKinsey Partner Aaron Bawcom, âAgentsâ capabilities can compound in reaction to their environments when they work together. They can develop unexpected behaviors and skills that are not explicitly programmed, equaling greater than the sum of their parts. This is whatâs known as emergent AI.â Learn more about QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. Lenovo, the Chinese technology company, has deployed AI agents in two main areas of its business: software engineering and customer support. Software engineers at the company are already seeing up to 15 percent improvements, says Arthur Hu, chief technology officer of Lenovoâs Solutions and Services Group. The companyâs COO and head of strategy, Linda Yao, adds that the customer service side has seen double-digit productivity gains in call handling time.  To date, Lenovo has refined gen AI agents to act as virtual assistants. In the future, Yao envisions AI agents acting as deputies to humans, deployed to complete tasks independently.  Here are three hypothetical use casesÂ that offer a glimpse of what could be possible with AI agents in the future: Learn more about QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey. Building trust is a big hurdleÂ in adopting AI agent technology, says McKinsey Partner Nicolai von Bismarck: âWe find that customers across all age groupsâeven Gen Zâstill prefer live phone conversations for customer help and support.â One bank, he continues, addressed this by creating an architecture that checks for errors or âhallucinationsâ from the AI agent before an answer is shared with a customer, thereby reducing the number of incorrect responses and building trust. âThe companies that derive the most value from AI,â says McKinsey Partner Roger Roberts, âwill be those that create trust with their customers, employees, and stakeholders. People must trust AI enough to hand over tasks. Companiesâ ethical decisions must be rooted in the values unique to each organization and the values of a society that places humans at the center of the AI ecosystem.â Another challenge, according to McKinsey Senior Partner  Amar, will be change management as organizations scale AI agents. âItâs much broader than simply rolling out a new set of tools,â he says. âCompanies are going to need to rewire how functions workÂ so they can get the full value from gen AI agents.â Part of this rewiring includes the adoption of new technologies, as well as tweaks to existing ones so that they work better with tools based on machine learningÂ and gen AI. Organizations should also adjust their operating models to support small teams that are working iteratively on new services. Whatâs more, leaders should create incentives that help workers learn how to useâand trustâthe new tools. Finally, âData protection is a major concern for leaders when it comes to deploying AI agents,â says McKinsey Partner Bawcom. Companies that are pursuing an AI agent program should carefully implement the proper controls for security, operations, and data. There are many evolving approaches and solutionsâboth off the shelf and bespoke. The proliferation of AI agents will likely change the way organizations run their technology programs. McKinsey anticipates that IT architectures will shift away from a traditional application-focused pattern to a new, multiagent model. In this type of architecture, tech leaders oversee up to thousands of agents that communicate with one another, as well as with humans and outside programs, to achieve a common goal.  Here are three ways that tech leaders could deploy agents within their current environments (Exhibit 2): Organizations will need to adjust their IT architectures to better serve these new agent-focused workflows and allow for continuous iteration and improvement.

Much of the work in the field of AI agents is moving out of the lab to full scale. AI agents offer new capabilities to help reimagine the ways that people work across organizations of all industries and sizes.  Learn more about QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.
